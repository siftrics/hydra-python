This repository contains the official [Hydra API](https://siftrics.com/) Python client. The Hydra API is a text recognition service.

# Quickstart

1. Install the package.

```
pip install hydra-api
```

or

```
poetry add hydra-api
```

etc.

1. Create a new data source on [siftrics.com](https://siftrics.com/).
2. Grab an API key from the page of your newly created data source.
3. Create a client, passing your API key into the constructor.
4. Use the client to processes documents, passing in the id of a data source and the filepaths of the documents.

```
import hydra_api

client = hydra_api.Client('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')

rows = client.recognize('my_data_source_id', ['invoice.pdf', 'receipt_1.png'])
```

`rows` looks like this:

```
[
  {
    "Error": "",
    "FileIndex": 0,
    "RecognizedText": { ... }
  },
  ...
]
```

`FileIndex` is the index of this file in the original request's "files" array.

`RecognizedText` is a dictionary mapping labels to values. Labels are the titles of the bounding boxes drawn during the creation of the data source. Values are the recognized text inside those bounding boxes.

# Using Base64 Strings Instead of File Paths

There is another function, `client.recognizeBase64(dataSourceId, base64Files, doFaster=False)`, which accepts base64 strings (file contents) instead of file paths. Because it is not trivial to infer MIME type from the contents of a file, you must specify the MIME type associated to each base64 file string: `base64Files` must be a list of `dict` objects containing two fields: `"mimeType"` and ``"base64File"`. Example:

```
    base64Files = [
        {
            'mimeType': 'image/png',
            'base64File': '...',
        },
        {
            'mimeType': 'application/pdf',
            'base64File': '...',
        },
    ]
    rows = client.recognizeBase64('Helm-Test-Againe', base64Files, doFaster=True)
```

# Faster Results

The `recognize` and `recognizeBase64` functions have an additional default parameter, `doFaster`, which defaults to `False`, but if it's set to `True` then Siftrics processes the documents faster at the risk of lower text recognition accuracy. Experimentally, doFaster=true seems not to affect accuracy when all the documents to be processed have been rotated no more than 45 degrees.

# Exporting JPGs instead of PNGs

The `recognize` and `recognizeBase64` functions have additional default parameters, `returnJpgs=False` and `jpgQuality=85`. If `returnJpgs` is set to `True`, then Siftrics returns cropped images in JPG format instead of PNG format. `jpgQuality` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
